            <p class="center">The old mill was an important part of Killesher's industrial heritage and it was the focus of a community restoration programme to repurpose it for 
              community regneration. In the early 1800’s Tully Mill was a corn mill and kiln and was part of a larger industrial complex which included a sawmill, 
              school, two mill races, two mill ponds, and a candle wick manufactory. The complex was part of a larger agricultural and industrial complex owned and 
              operated by nearby Florence Court House. Other industrial activities in the area included the manufacture of Florencecourt bricks, roof tiles, floor 
              tiles and drainage pipes as well as Arney slap bricks. Other sites of interest nearby include Bumper Lodge, a well preserved early Christian Rath 
              and Wesley’s Tree, named after the founder of Methodism, John Wesley, who is said to have preached there..</p>

              <p>KCDA was established in 1994 as a cross-community group with a management committee 
                drawn equally from both main communities and has successfully developed a community & social enterprise around the 
                old mill, mill race and pond. Its aim is to improve the quality of life for the local population through the 
                provision of social services and activities, infrastructural improvement, and opportunities for economic development. 
                KCDA has been involved in a large and varied number of community development and rural regeneration projects and activities since it was established. 
                The organisations community hub is the Larganess centre which is a neutral shared space open to all, and a meeting place for a number of local organsiations 
                including KCDA, Mill Club Senior Citizen group, Toddle Tots parent and baby/child group, and Killesher Historical Society in addition to a number of social, 
                recreational, educational and health & wellbeing activities and events.</p>
              </br>
              <p class="center">From 2013 to 2021 KCDA was also a key community delivery partner with the award-winning Battles, Bricks and Bridges and Cuilcagh to Cleenish projects, and 
                played a pivotal and strategic role in delivering its successful outcomes. </p>
              </br>
              <p class="center">As a community enterprise KCDA owns and manages the Larganess Centre which is the small community hall and kitchen for its community activities. 
                KCDA leases Tully Mill restaurant, which is the refurbished old mill, and six tourist cottages to a private enterprise to generate income for its activities</p>
