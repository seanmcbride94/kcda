        <h3>Tully Mill Complex</h3>
        <div class="col">
      <p class="pt-4">The corn mill and kiln at Tully townland was built as a manor mill around 1760 on the extensive estate of the Earl of Enniskillen at Florence Court. 
        Its internal gearing was made entirely of wood and was hailed at the time as a testimony to the skills and ingenuity of the carpenters and millwrights who 
        made it. The milling mechanism was once regarded as the best example of power transmission in Ulster but had, at the time of its refurbishment, completely 
        deteriorated beyond repair. All that remains today is the original building, water wheel, mill pond, sluice gates and race. Tully Mill was also part of a 
        larger industrial hub in the vicinity which included a larger mill that was over its lifetime, a linen bleaching mill, candlewick manufactory (the largest 
        in Ireland), a scutch mill, and a sawmill. A second wheel was installed in the 1920’s to generate electricity and a cutting-edge Craig Turbine was later added 
        before it was finally abandoned. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p class="pt-4">Another major industrial activity developed in the area by the Earl of Enniskillen was the construction of a brick and tile manufactory 
                known as the Tilery. Using local Arney clay it produced factory quality Florence Court bricks, roof tiles, floor tiles and drainage pipes. The same 
                source of clay had been used for centuries by local farmers who lived along the Arney River to make traditional slap bricks which were transported by 
                cot to Enniskillen. The Tully Mill site also included a miller’s cottage, school, rectory and Wesley’s Tree which was planted by the founder of 
                Methodism John Wesley when he preached there. </p>
